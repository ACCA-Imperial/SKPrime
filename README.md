SKPrime: A numerical implementation of the Schottky-Klein prime function in MATLAB.

This software is still experimental, and as such should only be relied on for computations with caveats. Documentation is sparse and in progress. Any quesions should be directed to Everett.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download a zip of the master branch of the repository.
* Unpack the zip somewhere.
* Run the `install.m` function from MATLAB in the directory you've just unzipped.
    * This will put the SKPrime directory on your MATLAB search path.
* See the `example.m` file for usage examples.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Ask Everett.
* TBD

### Contact ###

* Everett Kropf <e.kropf@imperial.ac.uk>
